Let's use arrow keys to control Mario and collect the coins. Mario moves on a board with the size of 10x10 fields.
There is a coin on the random field of the board.
When you catch a coin it will disappear from the board and appear on a different field, also random, and you get 1 point.
The game ends when Mario collides with the wall.
